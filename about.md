## Background
I am currently a 3rd year Software Engineering undergrad at Concordia University, 
Montreal, Canada. I was taught Java in University as a first programming language. As
soon as I knew the basics, I jumped into Android world, taking an
[online course](https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1) to start developing
small apps to the best of my capabilities.

I also got interested in web development with the goal of eventually becoming a
networking mastermind. I chose to learn Python for two reasons. First of all, 
I wanted to understand the hype about the language; second of all, 
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). Just like with Java, as soon as I knew
my way around Python, I scratched Django's surface by following the tutorials offered on the
official website. However, my learning was interrupted by a contract I landed - making a 
[website for a professional singer](http://www.frederickuku.com). I used the well-known
LAMP (P for PHP in my case) stack; I chose not to use any web framework in order to see
how *vanilla* implementations work and to better appreciate what frameworks 
do for you if/when I will be using one in the future. 

## Where I'm heading
What I've mostly done is high-level programming and I'm getting fairly comfortable with it.
However, I am deeply interested in lower level programming, including pretty much
everything that involves C/C++. Learning node.js to its core was then a no-brainer
for me; a popular and rapidly growing technology written in C/C++ and JavaScript! Oh and
by the way, I'm also very excited for JavaScript. Not only it is the language
of the web (even though it will probably change in the not-so-future with 
[WebAssembly](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/the-web-is-getting-its-bytecode-webassembly/)),
I am aware that functional programming is very powerful and that it can be very
beneficial to be proficient in a functional programming language. JavaScript
is an entry point for me in this paradigm.

Other than the current project I am working on, node.js, my dream would be to become
a linux kernel hacker. The way I see it, if you can hack the kernel, you can do pretty
much anything you want. That's where I'm heading.
