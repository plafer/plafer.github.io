I am currently a third year Computer Science undergrad at
Concordia University in Montreal. Ever since the moment I started
reading my first textbook about programming, I have not been able to
quench my thirst for more.

During my first year in university, I studied mostly Java and Android,
introduced myself to Linux, and had an internship with Radialpoint. In the
second year, I did a lot of web programming (mostly HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a
PHP backend) which got me my second internship at GSoft. In January 2016, I
landed an internship at Microsoft, where I worked on a project involving
[Muzik's new smart heaphones](https://www.muzikconnect.com/). These headphones
have an integrated accelerometer, four programmable buttons and swipe
gestures. They can communicate with a device using Bluetooth. The task given to
my team was to design and implement a software development kit for Android and
iOS that would abstract away the nitty-gritty details of the Bluetooth protocol
and provide a clean
[API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). I was
tasked with designing and implementing the Android library.

I've also read tons of textbooks that taught me some core computer science
knowledge. One of them was the famous [Structure and Interpretations of Computer
Programs](https://www.amazon.ca/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Abelson/dp/0262510871). This
book uses the Scheme programming language to teach fundamental concepts about
data and procedures which apply to all programming languages. In the second part
of the book, we write an interpreter and a compiler for Scheme in Scheme. It is
a startling experience. Another one was [The Linux Programming
Interface](https://www.amazon.ca/Linux-Programming-Interface-System-Handbook/dp/1593272200),
in which I learned Linux and its system call interface in-depth. A last notable
one was Computer Organization and Design by Patterson and Hennessy, which made
me understand how hardware works, and tradeoffs between different computer
architectures.

As for open-source projects, I contributed to [libuv](http://libuv.org/), the
library used by Node.js for its event loop and asynchronous I/O. My
[contribution](https://github.com/libuv/libuv/pull/1060) was a simple one: I
exposed a private Windows-only function that translated system error codes into
libuv error codes, implemented the UNIX version of it, updated the documentation
and added a test. However, as I was working my way to this contribution, I read
the complete source code and understood at a deep level how libuv does things. I
also contributed to the Node.js project, where I [fixed a bug in the stream
module](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2616). Even though the pull request
was code reviewed, it never actually got merged in the project. Regardless, I
learned a lot about how open-source projects work and thoroughly enjoyed the
experience.

My latest projects were to implement my own operating system (thank you MIT for
putting [this awesome
course](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/overview.html) out for everyone!)
and to implement my own Scheme interpreter in C.

Finally, I am now exploring the awesome world of robotics!
